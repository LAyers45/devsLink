# *devsLink*
## What were the goals?
### We set out to create a server based application that allows the user to connect with developers and developers to link to work on projects as well as make personal profile pages. We also set out to display community projects to the sight.
## What technologies were used?
### Over a one month period we made an application utilizing node, react, heroku, Adobe XD, Illustrator, and Mongo databases to optimize the user experience for our application.
## What will the application be able to do for you?
### It will let you sign up and login to the application.
### It allows users to create a developer profile with links to their preferred webpage.
### It provides a way to view exceptional projects for the user.
### It allows you to contact developers and check out their credentials.
## Where can I find these impressive developers?
